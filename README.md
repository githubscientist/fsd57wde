- [x] Why react

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

Next.js is a React framework that allows you to build static and server-rendered applications using React and JavaScript.

Client Side Rendering (CSR) - It means that the page is rendered in the browser using JavaScript. The server sends a blank HTML page and the browser loads the JavaScript and renders the page.

Server Side Rendering (SSR) - It means that the page is rendered on the server and the server sends the fully rendered HTML page to the browser.

Single Page Application (SPA) - It is a web application that fits on a single page. It is built using JavaScript and it communicates with the server using APIs.

- [x] Setup react project
