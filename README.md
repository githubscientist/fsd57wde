React Router DOM:

In traditional web development, we have multiple pages and we navigate between them using hyperlinks. In a single-page application, we have only one page and we change what is displayed on that page using JavaScript. React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps UI in sync with the URL.
